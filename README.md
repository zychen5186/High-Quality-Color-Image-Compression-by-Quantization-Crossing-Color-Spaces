# High-Quality-Color-Image-Compression-by-Quantization-Crossing-Color-Spaces
An implementation of Zhu, Shuyuan Y., et al. "High-quality color image compression by quantization crossing color spaces." IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology 29.5 (2018): 1474-1487." using Python

## Environment
- python 3.7.11

## Packages
- math
- numpy
- opencv

## Usage 
- Please add a folder named "output_image" in the same layer as main.py to save the reconstructed image.
- Put your images into the "dataset" folder and name them from 1 to the last number. The default data type in my code is .png. Change it if necessary.
